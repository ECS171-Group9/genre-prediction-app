# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.git
.gitignore

# Python pycache:
__pycache__/
# Ignored by the build system
/setup.cfg

# Prevent these from being uploaded to the environment, lib/ and bin/ generated at deployment and node_modules
# is not needed as we need to build the front end locally to create the dist/ files then upload those
node_modules/
lib/
bin/
